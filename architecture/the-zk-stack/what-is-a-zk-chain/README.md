# What is a ZK Chain?

ZK chains are parallel-running instances of zkEVM that achieve consensus and finality on Ethereum. Much like hyperlinks in the traditional web connect various webpages, ZK chains utilize **elastic chains** to interconnect different rollups within the ecosystem, facilitating seamless interactions across chains.

ZK chains operate with a shared bridge contract on Ethereum and include native bridges between individual rollups, enhancing the overall interoperability and efficiency of the network. Key features of ZK chains include:

* **Elastic Chain**: ZK chains create an interconnected network, allowing for seamless interactions and asset transfers between different chains.
* **Shared Bridge Contract**: Operating with a common bridge contract on Ethereum's L1, ZK chains facilitate native bridging between individual rollups.
* **Trustless Validation**: The system ensures that rollups within the ZK chain ecosystem can validate each other without introducing additional trust assumptions.
* **Unified Governance**: A shared governance framework on L1 allows the ecosystem to coordinate updates and respond to vulnerabilities collectively.
* **Standardized Security**: All ZK chains must use the standardized zkEVM engine, ensuring consistent security and operational standards across the network.
