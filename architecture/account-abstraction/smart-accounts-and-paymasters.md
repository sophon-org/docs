# Smart Accounts and Paymasters

#### Smart Accounts

Smart Accounts are essentially fully programmable accounts, granting users unprecedented control and customization options. With Smart Accounts, users can personalize signature schemes, implement native multi-sig capabilities, establish spending limits, and define application-specific restrictions. This programmability empowers users to tailor their accounts to their specific needs and preferences, enhancing security and control over their digital assets.

#### Paymasters

Paymasters play a crucial role in facilitating transactions by sponsoring them for users. This functionality enables users to pay transaction fees using ERC20 tokens, offering greater flexibility and convenience. Moreover, paymasters can contribute to transaction validation by verifying specific conditions or requirements before execution, adding an extra layer of security and control.
