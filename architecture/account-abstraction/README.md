# Account Abstraction

Account abstraction (AA) is a transformative feature within ZKsync that revolutionizes account operation and transaction interaction, offering greater flexibility for developers. Unlike traditional blockchain architectures that distinguish between externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts, AA unifies these roles and introduces Smart Accounts and Paymasters, paving the way for a more versatile and user-friendly experience.

Native Account Abstraction on Sophon enables all accounts to be smart accounts and offers features like gas-less transactions. This greatly improves user interaction by eliminating the complexities typically associated with transaction fees and signatures.
