# ZK Rooted

Sophon's validium architecture, combined with ZKsync's proving system and Avail's data availability solution, allows for high scalability without compromising security:

* Sophon's validium roots keep transaction data off-chain, using Avail as a secure and efficient data availability layer.
* Avail's support for [KZG](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html) commitments synergizes with ZKPs, allowing for efficient data representation and faster proof generation.
