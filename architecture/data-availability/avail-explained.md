# Avail, explained

Avail provides a scalable and cost-effective solution that aligns perfectly with Sophon’s vision for a secure and efficient entertainment ecosystem.

#### **Trust-Minimized Security**

Avail employs a hybrid consensus framework that combines [BABE](https://docs.availproject.org/docs/learn-about-avail/consensus/babe) (Block Production), [GRANDPA](https://docs.availproject.org/docs/learn-about-avail/consensus/grandpa) (Finality), and [Nominated Proof of Stake](https://docs.availproject.org/docs/learn-about-avail/consensus/npos) (NPoS) to ensure network resilience and security. This framework allows Avail to maintain security even during network disruptions, with a light client network enabling the Sophon community to actively participate in securing data.

#### **Future-Proof Scalability**

Avail’s modular design allows it to scale dynamically with demand. By integrating light clients with Data Availability Sampling (DAS), Avail can expand block sizes without impacting applications. This flexibility is crucial for Sophon’s integration with ZKsync.

#### **Validium Architecture**

Sophon utilizes a Validium architecture, which keeps transaction data off-chain while relying on Avail for secure DA. This combination allows Sophon to achieve high scalability without compromising security, supported by Avail’s efficient data representation through KZG commitments and ZKsync’s proving system.

#### **Cost-Effectiveness**

By decoupling DA from execution, Avail reduces operational costs, making it possible for Sophon to support high-throughput applications like gaming and social platforms with minimal on-chain expenses.

#### **Performance**

Avail's architecture supports efficient block production and finalization, with tested block sizes up to 128MB. This capacity ensures that Sophon can handle large-scale applications without compromising performance.
