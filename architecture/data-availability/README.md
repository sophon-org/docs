# Data Availability

Data Availability (DA) refers to block producers publishing transaction data to the network, allowing validators to download and verify it. This concept is fundamental to the security and efficiency of any blockchain system.&#x20;

The DA problem consists of two crucial aspects: Security & Cost. Most Layer 2 solutions rely on Ethereum for both settlement and DA. While this leverages Ethereum's robust security, it comes at a significant cost due to high gas fees.

Sophon has chosen Avail as its DA layer.
