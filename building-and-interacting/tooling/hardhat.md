# Hardhat

Developers working on Sophon can leverage robust Hardhat support to seamlessly compile, deploy, and interact with smart contracts optimized for its Validium-based ZK chain. This integration, built on the ZK Stack framework, allows projects using Solidity or Vyper to take full advantage of ZK technology, ensuring faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining Ethereum-level security.

**Key Features**

* **Comprehensive plugin suite:** Easily extend your Hardhat projects with ZKsync-specific functionality, from contract compilation to deployment and verification.
* **Optimized for zkRollups:** Deploy contracts that leverage the scalability and security of Sophon's Validium structure, reducing gas costs while maintaining trustless security.
* **Seamless integration:** The Hardhat integration is designed to work out-of-the-box with Sophon, simplifying setup and management of Layer 2 projects on the ZK Stack framework.
