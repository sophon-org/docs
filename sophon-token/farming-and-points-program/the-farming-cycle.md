# The Farming Cycle

Understanding the farming cycle is key to maximizing Sophon Points earned and participating in the broader Sophon ecosystem:

1. **Initial Farming period (Ethereum Mainnet)**: This is the initial phase during which users can deposit assets and earn Sophon Points. Sophon Points accrue until each asset is bridged to Sophon Mainnet. The duration of the farming period will be announced later.
2. **Farming on Sophon Mainnet:** Upon Sophon Mainnet launch, deposited assets (including boosted portions) will be bridged to the Sophon mainnet and made available to users. New deposits and boosts will be available on Sophon Mainnet as well. The accumulated Sophon Points will then be used to calculate rewards in $SOPH tokens based on the allocated percentage of the token supply.
