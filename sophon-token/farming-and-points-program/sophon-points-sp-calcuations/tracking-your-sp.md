# Tracking Your SP

* Real-time SP tracking: You can monitor your Sophon Points earned in real-time within the [Farming Portal](https://farm.sophon.xyz/).
* Accrual rates: Each pool displays its unique point accrual rate, indicating how quickly your points will accumulate. A userâ€™s individual rate within a pool is relative to the total deposits of all users in that pool. The amount of SP each pool earns per block is calculated using this formula:

```
Pool's SP per Block = (Total SP Per Block * Pool's Allocation) / Total Allocation of All Pools
```
