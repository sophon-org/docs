<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.avif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

$SOPH will be the native token for the Sophon network (meaning, the token to be used for gas fees).

Sophon network will allow for a set of decentralized sequencers to exist and collect fees in $SOPH (know more in [sophon-nodes.md](../../sophon-guardians-and-nodes/sophon-nodes.md "mention")).

Further utility for $SOPH is planned in the future.
