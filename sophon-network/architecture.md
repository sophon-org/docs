# Architecture

Sophon is a Validium ZK chain that utilizes the ZK Stack framework as its core technology.

Validiums serve as scaling solutions utilizing offchain data availability and computation to enhance throughput and reduce transactions costs. Their security is upheld by issuing validity proofs on Ethereum, which guarantees accurate state transitions, thereby ensuring the overall integrity of the Validium chain (meaning, if a ZK proof is verified on L1, you can fully trust the whole chain state).

Unlike zk-rollups that rely on onchain data availability, Validiums opt for an offchain data availability strategy. By striking a distinctive balance between operational efficiency and transparency, Validiums offer new use cases, including the possibility of withholding data (allowing enhanced or total privacy), while maintaing a fully trustless environment.
