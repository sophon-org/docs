Built on the ZKsync codebase, it is a modular, open-source framework offering developers complete control over their chainâ€™s architecture, including sequencers, data availability modes, and tokenomics.

ZK Stack unlocks:

* **Enhanced UX.** Native Account Abstraction enables a frictionless, one-click user experience, streamlining interactions and improving usability.
* **High Throughput.** The efficiency of the ZK Stack integrated into our architecture enables the processing of a large volume of transactions, surpassing the performance of similar platforms.
* **Affordability.** ZK Stack offers the option of ultra-low-cost accounts for use cases where cost efficiency is paramount.
