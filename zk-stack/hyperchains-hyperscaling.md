# Hyperchains/Hyperscaling

Ethereum, currently processing around 12 transactions per second, must scale to handle millions of transactions for a future of global on-chain financial activities. Achieving this in a decentralized structure poses significant challenges. Various solutions, including Polkadot, Cosmos, Near, and Eth 2.0, have been explored with multi-chain or shard architectures, but full trust remains an issue. The widely accepted solution for these challenges lies in zero-knowledge proofs, offering cryptographic security. Combined with the DA layer and ZK Rollups, these can create a secure, scalable ecosystem, making Ethereum accessible to all.

### &#x20;What are Hyperchains? <a href="#what-are-hyperchains" id="what-are-hyperchains"></a>

Hyperchains are fractal-like instances of zkEVM running in parallel and with the common settlement on the L1 mainnet. The name Hyperbridge comes from the traditional web, where users can navigate websites using hyperlinks. Similarly, ZkSync's rollups will be connected with Hyperbridges.
