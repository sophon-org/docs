# Validiums

Sophon is a validium L2.

Validiums serve as scaling solutions utilizing off-chain data availability and computation to enhance throughput through off-chain transaction processing. Their security is upheld by issuing validity proofs on Ethereum, which guarantees accurate state transitions, thereby ensuring the overall integrity of the Validium chain.

Unlike zk-rollups that rely on on-chain data availability, Validiums opt for an off-chain data availability strategy. This difference not only influences their security profile but also their level of trustlessness. By striking a distinctive balance between operational efficiency and data privacy, Validiums offer new use cases. Validiums allow near-instant withdrawals, enabled by the verification of validity proofs on Ethereum and the provision of Merkle proofs by users.
