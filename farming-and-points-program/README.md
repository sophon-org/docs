# Farming & Points Program

The Sophon Farm is designed to allow users to contribute to Sophon's growth while earning rewards. To reward the loyal community, 10% of the $SOPH token supply will be dedicated to early supporters through the [Sophon Farm](https://farm.sophon.xyz/). By depositing assets into pools (like ETH, BEAM and more), you'll accumulate _**Sophon Points (SP)**_ with every new block. Sophon Farm will initially be available on Ethereum Mainnet, followed by a second farming period on Sophon Mainnet.

## Farming period token distribution

* Ethereum Mainnet Farming: 6% of the total $SOPH token supply.
* Sophon Mainnet Farming: 4% of the total $SOPH token supply (Sophon Mainnet Farming rules will be announced before launch).

## Terms and conditions

Participation in the Sophon Farming and the $SOPH airdrop is subject to the [Token Airdrop Terms & Conditions](https://main.staging.farm.sophon.xyz/token-airdrop-terms.html) and any Disclaimers included in the Farming Portal. Note that geographical restrictions apply.
