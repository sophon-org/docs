Once zkSync enables proof-of-authority for Hyperchains (ETA Q3 2024), running a node on Sophon will contribute to the decentralization of the Sophon network and it is intended that node operators will earn rewards from being participants in the consensus of the network. Technical documentation will be made available in due course.

Revenue from that is simply: num txs \* tx fee

Moreover, up to 20% of the total supply of the $SOPH token is allocated for node operators in Sophonâ€™s ecosystem, to be released over the course of the next three years (assuming continued participation as a node operator for the duration of that period). The intention is that the tokenomics of the $SOPH token will set aside that total percentage amount for the node operators specifically.
