# Sophon Guardians

**Sophon Guardians**, also simply called **Guardians**, are the cornerstone of the Sophon network's operational infrastructure. The rights to operate a Sophon Node are managed through **Guardians**. These licenses are tied to the nodes purchased during the node sale. As a Guardian, you gain the capability to run a Sophon Node.

**Short Term:**

* **Delegation:** Licenses can be delegated to the main node (sequencer), allowing holders to earn part of the 20% SOPH token allocation.
* **Social Signaling:** Future features like profiles and chat may include stickers and badges for license holders.
* **Airdrops:** License holders may receive airdrops from partner projects.

**Medium Term:**

* **Light Node Operation:** License holders can run Sophon light nodes or delegate to others running them, earning rewards.

**Long Term:**

* **Network Validation:** License holders can participate in network validation by running decentralized nodes or delegating their licenses. Rewards will include both SOPH tokens and network fees.
* **Exclusive Access:** Licenses may provide early access to events, exclusive DeFi opportunities, investment syndicates, and alpha groups.
