# Sophon Guardians

**Sophon Guardians**, also simply called **Guardians**, are the cornerstone of the Sophon network's operational infrastructure. The rights to operate a Sophon Node are managed through **Guardians**. These licenses are tied to the nodes purchased during the node sale. As a Guardian, you gain the capability to run a Sophon Node.

Becoming a Guardian is directly tied to the node sale process. When you purchase a node during Sophon's node sale events, you automatically become a Sophon Guardian. As a Guardian, you're not just a passive investor. You're responsible for setting up and maintaining the node you've purchased, actively contributing to the network's operations and security.
