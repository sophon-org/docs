# Sophon Guardians

**Sophon Guardians**, also simply called **Guardians**, are the cornerstone of the Sophon network's operational infrastructure. The rights to operate a Sophon Node are managed through Guardians memberships, which are tied to the nodes purchased during the node sale. As a Guardian, you gain the capability to run a Sophon Node, or to delegate your membership to other entities running nodes

When you become a Guardian, you’re not a passive investor. You're a key player, a protector of the realm. You’re responsible for taking part in ensuring Sophon is safe and reliable, by either setting up and maintaining a full node, running a light node, or just delegating your membership, actively contributing to the network’s operations and security.

As an incentive for their crucial role, Guardians will be rewarded with 20% of the total SOPH supply, distributed over a 36-month period, with specific distribution rules to be announced in the near future.
