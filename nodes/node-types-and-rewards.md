# Node Types and Rewards

Rewards will be distributed weekly, with a 3-month lock-up period. Any undistributed tokens after the 156 weeks will be burned, to ensure a fair and deflationary distribution model. Entities not performing as expected may be slashed (rules to be defined as we approach mainnet)
