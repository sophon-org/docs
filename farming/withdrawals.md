# Withdrawals

You can withdraw your deposited assets (excluding boosted portions) at any time during the farming period _**without penalty**_. That means that any SP earned up to the point of withdrawal will still count towards your final $SOPH reward allocation at the end of the Ethereum Mainnet farming period. However, you will no longer accumulate SP on the withdrawn assets.
