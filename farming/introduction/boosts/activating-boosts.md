# Activating Boosts

Upon depositing to a pool, a user can boost their portion or the entirety of their deposit. Boosting is a strategic decision for increasing the total SP a user can earn:

* **Boost activation:** A user permanently allocates a portion of deposited assets to activate a boost. Permanently committed deposits will be allocated to provide liquidity on Sophon mainnet.
* **Partial or full boost:** You can choose to boost a portion of your deposit or the entire amount. The more you boost, the greater your SP earned. For instance, if a user deposits 1000 BEAM and chooses to boost 200 BEAM, they'll have 800 BEAM left in their unboosted deposit. However, they will now earn Sophon Points at an accelerated rate (5x) on the 200 BEAM that were boosted, resulting in a higher number of Sophon Points than if they did not boost.
