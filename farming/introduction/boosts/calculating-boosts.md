# Calculating Boosts

1. **Boost multiplier:** The current booster multiplier is 5x, meaning your boosted assets earn Sophon Points at five times the rate.
2. **Boosted amount:** Your boosted amount is multiplied by the booster multiplier to calculate your total boosted Sophon Points.
3. T**otal earning power:** Your total earning potential is the sum of your unboosted deposit and your boosted amount.

**Example: Boosting 200 BEAM with a 5x multiplier**

Let's say you deposit 1000 BEAM and choose to boost 200 BEAM. This leaves you with an unboosted deposit of 800 BEAM. With a 5x multiplier, your 200 BEAM principal is amplified to a 1000 BEAM virtual stake (200 BEAM \* 5). As a result, your total staking power becomes 1800 BEAM (800 unboosted + 1000 boosted). This means you'll earn SP as if you had deposited 1800 BEAM, even though you only deposited 1000. However, it's important to remember that only 800 BEAM of the original 1000 BEAM that you deposited will be available for withdrawal.
