# Boosts

Boosting allows you to "supercharge" your deposit and earn more Sophon Points over time. It’s important to note that the **deposited assets used to activate boosters will be permanently committed,** as they will be allocated for the purpose of providing liquidity on Sophon mainnet (an ‘ownerless’ liquidity position) and enabling the growth of the Sophon ecosystem. Any LP tokens created during this process will be burned. The initial boost multiplier is set at 5x, but this is subject to change based on various factors like community response and supply and demand.

**Once you activate a boost with a specific multiplier, it's locked in.** Even if the base multiplier changes later on, your boost remains at the rate you initially activated it. This means you'll continue to benefit from your chosen multiplier throughout the duration of your boost, regardless of any future adjustments to boost multipliers.

Remember, the assets used for boosting are permanently locked and will be dedicated to providing liquidity on the Sophon mainnet. You will not be able to withdraw those assets in the future.
