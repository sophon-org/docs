# Active pools

The Sophon Farm smart contracts offer convenient deposit functions that automatically convert specific assets to their yield-bearing counterparts (when available):

* **BEAM**
* **BEAM/ETH**
* **stZENT**
* **ETH**
* **wETH** &#x20;
* **eETH**
* **weETH**
* **stETH**
* **wstETH**

Following the initial deployment of the farming program, more pools are scheduled to be released.

_**Note: Conversions are one-way, meaning your withdrawal will be in the converted asset form.**_
