**Sophon Guardians** are the cornerstone of the Sophon network's operational infrastructure. The rights to operate a Sophon Node are managed through [Guardians memberships](sophon-guardian-membership.md), which are initially tied to the nodes purchased during the [node sale](node-sale/). As a Guardian, you gain the capability to run a Sophon Node, or to delegate your membership to other operators running nodes

When you become a Guardian, you’re not a passive Sophon stakeholder. You're a key player, a protector of the realm. You’re responsible for taking part in ensuring Sophon is safe and reliable, by either setting up and maintaining a full node, running a light node, or just delegating your membership, actively contributing to the network’s operations and security.
