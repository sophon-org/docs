# Sophon Guardian Membership

Sophon Guardian membership is represented through an ERC-721 NFT on the Sophon network. This NFT allows node operators to participate in network operations and governance, specifically by delegating their rights and responsibilities to addresses actively running Sophon Nodes.

### Using Your Guardian Membership

Once you have claimed your Guardian Membership NFT, you can use it in multiple ways:

1. **Delegate to Sophon Nodes**: Your NFT allows you to delegate your ownership to addresses running various types of Sophon Nodes, including sequencer nodes and light nodes.
2. **Participate in Network Operations**: Depending on the number of licenses you hold, you can run different types of nodes:
   * To run a Sophon sequencer node, an entity must have at least 1,500 node licenses delegated to it.
3. **Earn Rewards**: By delegating to active Sophon Nodes or running nodes yourself, you can earn a share of the 20% SOPH token allocation reserved for node operators and delegates.
4. **Access Additional Features**: Your license can be used for multiple purposes simultaneously. For example, you can delegate to a sequencer node while also running an Avail light client and accessing events with it.

For detailed information on Sophon Nodes, please refer to our [Sophon Node documentation](https://docs.sophon.xyz/nodes/sophon-node).
