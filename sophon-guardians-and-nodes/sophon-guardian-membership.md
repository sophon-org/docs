# Sophon Guardian Membership

The Sophon Guardian membership is represented through an NFT (ERC-721 token) on the Sophon network. This NFT allows holders to operate Sophon nodes, or to delegate the token to Sophon node operators, and thereby participate in network operations (know more reading [Sophon Nodes](sophon-nodes.md) and [Node Rewards](node-rewards.md)).

### Claiming your membership

Subject to the [Node Sale Terms and Conditions](https://farm.sophon.xyz/node-sale-terms) (including passing KYC requirements), participants of the Sophon [node sale](node-sale/) will be able to claim their membership NFTs soon. Check back for updates.&#x20;

The Sophon Guardian membership is non-transferable for the first year after its genesis.

### Using Your Guardian Membership

Once you have claimed your Guardian Membership NFT, you can use it in multiple ways:

1. **Delegate to Sophon Nodes operators**: Your membership can be delegated to addresses running both Full and Light Sophon Nodes. Operators running these nodes will have to specify the reward distribution for Sophon Guardians that have delegated to them.
2. **Participate in Network Operations**: Anyone can run a Sophon node, but rewards for doing so depends on meeting applicable network criteria, starting with the number of memberships you hold or have been delegated.
   * To run a [Sophon full node](sophon-nodes.md#sophon-full-node) and be part of the consensus network (coming soon), an operator must have at least 1,500 guardian memberships delegated to it. We expect a maximum of 100 nodes performing network sequencing.
   * To run a [Sophon light node](sophon-nodes.md#sophon-light-node) and be rewarded for doing so, an operator must have between 1 and 20 guardian memberships delegated to it. This means that if you don't have any memberships, you won't receive rewards. If you have more than 20 memberships (e.g., 30), you should split them between multiple light nodes to ensure all memberships are eligible for rewards. This cap aims to ensure good balance between the numbers of light nodes and network needs.
3. **Rewards**: By delegating to active Sophon Nodes (including your own), you become eligible to earn a share of the 20% $SOPH token allocation reserved for node operators and delegates. Learn more about [Node Rewards](node-rewards.md) here.
