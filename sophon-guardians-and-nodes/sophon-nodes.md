  Sophon network utilizes two types of nodes: Full Nodes and Light Nodes. Both
  play crucial roles in maintaining the network's liveness and security.

# Sophon Nodes

### Sophon Full Node

A **Sophon Full Node** is a complete node that maintains a full copy of the blockchain. In the early stages of the network, only one node (operated by the Sophon foundation) is authorized to submit batches, but work is ongoing to decentralize this process.

### What is a Sophon Light Node?

Sophon Light Nodes are lightweight software designed to perform simpler tasks within the Sophon network, with the initial version still under development. These nodes represent a cost-effective way to participate in the network, downloading only the minimum data needed to transact, typically just block headers. Unlike full nodes that store complete blockchain data and participate in block verification and validation, light nodes use the minimum amount of data possible to interact with the blockchain, outsourcing all other information from full nodes. This makes light nodes the most basic and accessible type of node, offering an entry point for users who want to engage with the network without the resource demands of running a full node.
