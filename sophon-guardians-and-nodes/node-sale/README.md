* A total of 200,000 nodes were made available through a tiered pricing system.
* The first 13 tiers were capped. Details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ULyfJ9z18Ujq\_AMCNun2d55uZkNZUeqDvm9u127c5bE/edit?pli=1\&gid=1097826785#gid=1097826785).
* There was no cap on the number of nodes one could purchase in tier 13 and beyond.

### Node License Details

* Licenses are non-transferable for one year.
